# Monitoring_incidents_with_SEIM_Tool

<h2>Description</h2>
Monitor and examined cyber security incidents with SIEM tools.
<br />
<h3>With my setup in place, I have the capability to closely monitor the network within Microsoft Sentinel. This means I can keep a vigilant eye on all the activities and events happening in my network. In addition, I'll receive alerts whenever the system detects any suspicious or potentially harmful actions. These alerts serve as early warnings that prompt me to investigate and take necessary actions. Essentially, it's a proactive way of ensuring the security and integrity of my network, as I can promptly respond to any issues that may arise.</h3>  <br/>

<h3>I will proceed to investigate alerts in Sentinel and assess the presence of threat events.</h3>
